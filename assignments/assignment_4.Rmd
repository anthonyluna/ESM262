```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```
```{r}
source(here("R","fish_summary.R"))
```
There are a couple ways to read in this text file. We used `read_delim`.

```{r}
fish_data_df <- read_delim(file = here("assignments","fish.txt"),delim = ",")

# function requires an atomic vector input
fish_data <- as.vector(fish_data_df$x)
```

Run with the fishtogram!

```{r}
fish_summary(fish_data, fishtogram = TRUE)
```

Default run without the fishtogram returned.

```{r}
fish_summary(fish_data)
```
